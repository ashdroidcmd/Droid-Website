Button Toggle LED (Press to Turn ON/OFF)
Instead of keeping the LED on only while pressing the button, this version toggles the LED state each time the button is pressed.

ðŸ›  Components Needed:
Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
LED
Resistor (220Î©) (For LED)
Push Button
Resistor (10kÎ©) (For button pull-down)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard (Optional)

ðŸ”Œ Circuit Connections:
LED:

Anode (Long leg) â†’ Arduino Pin 9
Cathode (Short leg) â†’ GND through 220Î© resistor

Button:

One leg â†’ Arduino Pin 2
Other leg â†’ GND (through a 10kÎ© resistor)
Also connect one side of the button to 5V

ðŸ’» Arduino Code (Toggle LED)
const int buttonPin = 2;  // Button connected to pin 2
const int ledPin = 9;     // LED connected to pin 9

bool ledState = false;    // LED state (ON/OFF)
bool lastButtonState = HIGH;
bool currentButtonState;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Internal pull-up resistor
}

void loop() {
  currentButtonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // Check if button was pressed (change from HIGH to LOW)
  if (currentButtonState == LOW && lastButtonState == HIGH) {
    ledState = !ledState;  // Toggle LED state
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState ? HIGH : LOW);
    delay(200);  // Debounce delay to avoid multiple triggers
  }

  lastButtonState = currentButtonState;
}
ðŸš€ Explanation:
Uses a boolean variable (ledState) to track LED status.
Detects button press transition (HIGH to LOW) to toggle the LED.
Debounce delay (200ms) prevents unwanted multiple toggles due to bouncing.
âœ… Enhancements:

Add multiple buttons to toggle different LEDs.
Use an OLED screen or LCD to display the LED state.
Implement long-press functionality for dimming or brightness control.
