Turning on an LED with an Arduino is one of the simplest beginner projects. 

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Components Needed:
Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
LED
Resistor (220Î© or 330Î©)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)


Wiring Diagram:
Long leg (anode, +) â†’ Connect to Arduino digital pin 13 (or any other digital pin) through a 220Î© or 330Î© resistor
Short leg (cathode, -) â†’ Connect to GND.


Arduino Code:
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 13 as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  // Turn LED on
  delay(1000);             // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // Turn LED off
  delay(1000);             // Wait for 1 second
}


Explanation:
pinMode(13, OUTPUT); â†’ Sets pin 13 as an output.
digitalWrite(13, HIGH); â†’ Turns the LED ON.
delay(1000); â†’ Waits for 1 second.
digitalWrite(13, LOW); â†’ Turns the LED OFF.
The loop repeats indefinitely, making the LED blink every second.
